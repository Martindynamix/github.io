                            Using this Website binds you to some very basic terms and licensing agreements. You
                            understand that any and all third party Frameworks, Brands, Images, Trademarks and
                            code snippets belong to their propietary and or personal owners. You must asdhere to all
                            third party use agreements.
                            As far as my personal composites and images these are licensed to others using the creative
                            commons licensing system.
                            The actual license can be found below under the heading <i>images and icons</i>
                        <h2 class="license-sub-heading">In Addition</h2>
                        <p class="in-addition">
                            Composites and Images that I Own must be kept intact. Use that distorts an image is not
                            allowed. My images may be shared and used commercially provided its not
                            sharing in a derogatory manner. Meaning modification, distortion or vandalism. Use of images
                            that I own or anothers images may not be used in a defamatory manner.
                            Absolutely no imaging or content whatsoever may be used to harass insult or even criticise a
                            minor EVER! This does not mean basic criticism or reference to content
                            for criticisms. You may criticise me all you want. You must adhere to the licensing terms
                            when criticising however. In a nutshell my licensing terms are easy, provide attribution
                            as previously stated concureent with the creative commons requirements. Third party images
                            will have their own use terms outside of this site. You must adhere to all of their terms as
                            well.
                            There may be more contributors to some of my composites. Ususally this will be listed in
                            meta data somewhere. E.T. within an SVG's XML or the properties
                            menu. If not, you are off the hook. PLease give credit to thos whom I credit in turn.
